* Quasars are the brightest things we can see in the universe (and as a correlary, the oldest things!)

This is an experiment in fully prodecural stochastic quasar generation. It's my first foray into 3D modeling or rendering of any sort. The question is: how cool can we make the quasar look without resorting to pre-created assets like custom textures or maps?

Instead of having a fairly limited number of objects with defined textures, the approach I'm taking is to have *lots* of extremely simple, generated objects that combine to appear awesome.
